 * Write a method called exponent(int base, int exp) that returns an int value of base raises to
 * the power of exp. The signature of the method is:
 * public static int exponent (int base, int exp);
 * Assume that exp is a non-negative integer and base is an integer. Do not use any Math library functions.
 * Also write the testExponent() method that prompts user for the base and exp; and prints the result.
